# Themes and the WSUWP Platform

The WSUWP platform will work with any standard theme. By default, WSU will offer a parent theme that is oriented around the branding guidelines set forth by University Communications and the web guidelines provided by Web Communication.

Over time, additional parent themes will be added. Child themes and additional parent themes can be submitted for a variety of custom layouts for individual sites.

As with plugins, some themes will be available Globally, some will be network wide, and some will be tied to a specific site.
